# Imformation
## What is this?
This is a GoGuardian bypasser, obviously.
## How does this work?
It works by using Iframes, or, for those of you who dont know HTML or anything that involves programming, it mean Inline Frame. This is basically embedding one website into another.
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
 <body>
  <div>
  <iframe src="Your URL goes here!">
  </div>
 </body>
 ```
 Also, some websites wont work because of Xframes.
 ## Wait, what are those?
 Basically, they are an element that makes it impossible for the website to be embedded in any website.
 # Other Stuff
 I just wanted to say that this was inspired by **GamerVerse722** and **echo0devv**. I would not even know about this exploit if it werent for them. And yes, I am aware on replit this is not working, and I am trying to fix it as soon as possible.
